# Generate-Faces
In this project, i define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!  The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; my generated samples look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
